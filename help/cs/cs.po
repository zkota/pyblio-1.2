"<app>Pybliographer</app>, because they hide the underlying access mechanism, "
"and provide the same access on any database. They are also perfectly suited "
"for implementing transparent filtering and sorting of entries: the "
"<em>Selection.Selection</em> class for example takes an iterator (on a "
"database for example) and return a new one which will only iterate on a "
"subset of the entries, according to a search criterion."
