  Abstract       = {The PS II-S protein and the so-called early
                   light-inducinble proteins (ELIPs) are homologous to the
                   chlorophyll a/b-binding (Cab) gene products functioning
                   in light-harvesting. The functional significance of
                   these two CAB homologues is not known although they
                   have been considered to bind pigments and in the case
                   of the PS II-S protein this has been experimentally
                   supported. The role of these two proteins does not
                   appear to be light-harvesting but instead they are
                   suggested to play a role as quenchers of free
                   chlorophyll molecules during biogenesis and/or
                   degradation of pigment-binding proteins. Such a role
                   would be essential to eliminate the toxic and damaging
                   effects that can be induced by free chlorophyll in the
                   light. To this end the expression and characteristics
                   of the ELIPs and the PS II-S protein were investigated
                   in spinach leaves acclimating from low to high light
                   intensities. Under these conditions there is a
                   reduction in the antenna size of Photosystem II due to
                   proteolytic digestion of its major chlorophyll
                   a/b-binding protein (LHC II). During this acclimative
                   proteolysis, up to one third of LHC II can be degraded
                   and consequently substantial amounts of chlorophyll
                   molecules will lose their binding sites. Our results
                   reveal that there is a close correlation between ELIP
                   accumulation and the onset of the LHC II degradation as
                   low light-grown spinach leaves are subjected to
                   increased light intensities. In contrast, there was no
                   change in the relative level of the PS II-S protein
                   during the acclimation process. It is concluded that
                   the role for the ELIPS may be related to binding of
                   liberated chlorophyll molecules and quenching of the
                   toxic effects during LHC II degradation. In addition it
                   was shown that in spinach four different ELIP species
                   can be expressed and that they show different
                   accumulation patterns in response to increased light
                   intensities.},

                   etiolated leaves, the photosynthetic elektron transport
                   rapidly intensified as chlorophylls were accumulated.
                   The protein lipid ratio, however, did not change during
                   the firtst 24 hours and showed only slight increase at

                   a small lipophil spin labelled compound, into the

                   exhibited characteristic bandshift from 1652 cm-1 to
                   1656 cm-1 corresponding to the enhanced alfa-helix
                   content of the newly synthetised proteins. An other
                   Amide I component band was shifted from 1624 to 1632
                   cm-1 which indicates a definite increase of the

                   dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine were
                   investigated by using very high frequency electron
                   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Experiments
                   carried out at a microwave frequency of 94.3 GHz
                   completely resolved the TEMPO EPR spectrum in the
                   aqueous and hydrocarbon phases. An accurate computer
                   simulation method combined with Levenberg-Marquardt
                   optimization was used to analyze the TEMPO EPR spectra
                   in both phases. Spectral parameters extracted from the
                   simulations gave the actual partitioning of the TEMPO
                   probe between the LUV hydrocarbon and aqueous phases
                   and allowed analysis of picosecond rotational dynamics
                   of the probe in the LUV hydrocarbon phase. In very high
                   frequency EPR experiments, phase transitions in the
                   LUV-TEMPO system were observed as sharp changes in both
                   partitioning and rotational correlation times of the
                   TEMPO probe. The phase transition temperatures (40.5
                   +/- 0.2 and 32.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C) are in agreement
                   with previously reported differential scanning
                   microcalorimetry data. Spectral line widths were
                   analyzed by using existing theoretical expressions for
                   motionally narrowed nitroxide spectra. It was found
                   that the motion of the small, nearly spherical, TEMPO
                   probe can be well described by anisotropic Brownian
                   diffusion in isotropic media and is not restricted by
                   the much larger hydrocarbon chains existing in ripple

                   during illumination of dark-grown barley seedlings by
                   using biochemical methods, and Fourier transform
                   infrared and spin label electron paramagnetic resonance
                   spectroscopic techniques. Correlated, gross changes in
                   the secondary structure of membrane proteins,
                   conformation, composition, and dynamics of lipid acyl
                   chains, SDS/PAGE pattern, and thermally induced
                   structural alterations show that greening is
                   accompanied with the reorganization of membrane protein
                   assemblies and the protein-lipid interface. Changes in
                   overall membrane fluidity and noncovalent protein-lipid
                   interactions are not monotonic, despite the monotonic
                   accumulation of chlorophyll, LHCII [light-harvesting
                   chlorophyll a/b-binding (polypeptides) associated with
                   photosystem II] apoproteins, and 18:3 fatty acids that
                   follow a similar time course with highest rates between
                   12-24 h of greening. The 18:3 fatty acid content
                   increases 2.8-fold during greening. This appears to
                   both compensate for lipid immobilization by membrane
                   proteins and facilitate packing of larger protein
                   assemblies. The increase in the amount of
                   protein-solvating immobile lipids, which reaches a
                   maximum at 12 h, is caused by 40\% decrease in the
                   membranous mean diameter of protein assemblies at
                   constant protein/lipid mass ratio. Alterations in the
                   SDS/PAGE pattern are most significant between 6-24 h.
                   The size of membrane protein assemblies increasesapprox
                   4.5-fold over the 12-48-h period, likely caused by the
                   2-fold gain in LHCII apoproteins. The thermal stability
                   of thylakoid membrane proteins increases monotonically,
                   as detected by an increasing temperature of partial
                   protein unfolding during greening. Our data suggest
                   that a structural coupling between major protein and
                   lipid components develops during greening. This
                   protein-lipid interaction is required for the
