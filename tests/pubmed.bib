                   the best-characterized strain of Mycobacterium

                   this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception
                   of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The
                   genome comprises 4,411,529 base pairs, contains around
                   4,000 genes, and has a very high guanine + cytosine
                   content that is reflected in the blased amino-acid
                   content of the proteins. M. tuberculosis differs
                   radically from other bacteria in that a very large
                   portion of its coding capacity is devoted to the
                   production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and
                   lipolysis, and to two new families of glycine-rich
                   proteins with a repetitive structure that may represent
                   a source of antigenic variation.},

                   studying metabolic pathways. In an attempt to find out
                   more about how these pathways are constructed, the
                   enzymes were analysed by defining their protein
                   domains. Structural assignments and sequence
                   comparisons were used to show that 213 domain families
                   constitute approximately 90\% of the enzymes in the
                   small-molecule metabolic pathways. Catalytic or
                   cofactor-binding properties between family members are
                   often conserved, while recognition of the main
                   substrate with change in catalytic mechanism is only
                   observed in a few cases of consecutive enzymes in a
                   pathway. Recruitment of domains across pathways is very
                   common, but there is little regularity in the pattern
                   of domains in metabolic pathways. This is analogous to
                   a mosaic in which a stone of a certain colour is
                   selected to fill a position in the picture.},

  abstract       = {The 106 small molecule metabolic (SMM) pathways in
                   Escherichia coli are formed by the protein products of
                   581 genes. We can define 722 domains, nearly all of
                   which are homologous to proteins of known structure,
                   that form all or part of 510 of these proteins. This
                   information allows us to answer general questions on
                   the structural anatomy of the SMM pathway proteins and
                   to trace family relationships and recruitment events
                   within and across pathways. Half the gene products
                   contain a single domain and half are formed by
                   combinations of between two and six domains. The 722
                   domains belong to one of 213 families that have between
                   one and 51 members. Family members usually conserve
                   their catalytic or cofactor binding properties;
                   substrate recognition is rarely conserved. Of the 213
                   families, members of only a quarter occur in isolation,
                   i.e. they form single-domain proteins. Most members of
                   the other families combine with domains from just one
                   or two other families and a few more versatile families
                   can combine with several different partners.Excluding
                   isoenzymes, more than twice as many homologues are
                   distributed across pathways as within pathways.
                   However, serial recruitment, with two consecutive
                   enzymes both being recruited to another pathway, is
                   rare and recruitment of three consecutive enzymes is
                   not observed. Only eight of the 106 pathways have a
                   high number of homologues. Homology between consecutive
                   pairs of enzymes with conservation of the main
                   substrate-binding site but change in catalytic
                   mechanism (which would support a simple model of
                   retrograde pathway evolution) occurs only six times in
                   the whole set of enzymes. Most of the domains that form
                   SMM pathways have homologues in non-SMM pathways. Taken
                   together, these results imply a pervasive "mosaic"
                   model for the formation of protein repertoires and
                   pathways.},

                   involves significant cooking steps. However, the
                   information regarding Tiroi and Kina processing did not
                   supply the necessary data to identify definitely
                   whether fermentations were involved, and if they were,
                   what kind they may be. New Zealand has only experienced
                   one outbreak of botulism, and this was associated with
                   the consumption of Tiroi. It is, therefore, desirable
                   to identify the processes occurring in these foods
                   where the nature of these processes is not understood
                   in order to facilitate their safe future production.},

  abstract       = {This paper describes how biological function can be
                   represented in terms of molecular activities and
                   processes. It presents several key features of a data
                   model that is based on a conceptual description of the
                   network of interactions between molecular entities
                   within the cell and between cells. This model is
                   implemented in the aMAZE database that presently deals
                   with information on metabolic pathways, gene
                   regulation, sub- or supracellular locations, and
                   transport. It is shown that this model constitutes a
                   useful generalisation of data representations currently
                   implemented in metabolic pathway databases, and that it
                   can furthermore include multiple schemes for
                   categorising and classifying molecular entities,
                   activities, processes and localisations. In particular,
                   we highlight the flexibility offered by our system in
                   representing multiple molecular activities and their
                   control, in viewing biological function at different
                   levels of resolution and in updating this view as our
                   knowledge evolves.},
