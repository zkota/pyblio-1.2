Title
  Seismic events discrimination by neuro-fuzzy merging of
  signal and catalogue features
Source
  Physics & Chemistry of the Earth Part A-Solid Earth & Geodesy. 24(3):201-206,
  1999.
Abstract
  This article presents an original method for the classification of low
  magnitude seismic events recorded in France by a network of
  seismometers. Three types of events are discriminated: earthquakes, mining
  blasts and rock bursts. This method is based on a merging of catalogue
  measurements and possibly incomplete measurements deduced from several
  seismic signals related to the event. The merging is
  performed by a multi-layer neural network. A fuzzy coding is
  applied to the input characteristics of the neural network.
  It allows the network to integrate data imperfections during the learning
  phase. Then, it is possible to process efficiently incomplete data. The
  results are obtained on a database composed of all the 1,402
  seismic events recorded between August 23(rd) 1993 and May
  30(th) 1994. They show that the fuzzy coding and the merging of catalogue
  features and signal features extracted from several seismometers for each
  event increase the performance of correct classification to more than 90%
  even when the database contains missing values. The confusion rate between
  earthquakes and mining blasts is simultaneously reduced. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title
  Heterogeneity of the uppermost mantle beneath Russian Eurasia from the
  ultra-long-range profile QUARTZ
Source
  Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth. 104(B9):20329-20348, 1999 Sep

Abstract
  The 3850-km long Deep Seismic Sounding profile QUARTZ
  crosses six major geologic provinces in Eurasia and is sourced by 3 nuclear
  and 48 chemical explosions. We present the first interpretation of the entire
  data set, using two dimensional (2-D) ray tracing and inversion, resolution
  analysis, and 1-D amplitude modeling. Our interpretation shows a 42-km-thick,
  high-velocity crust under the Baltic Shield, a 29-km-thick crust and
  high-velocity upper mantle under the Mezenskaya depression, 52-km-thick crust
  with high-velocity lower crust and uppermost mantle under the Urals, and
  40-km-thick crust under the West Siberian basin deepening to 45 km under the
  Altay-Sayan fold belt. High-velocity (8.4 km/s) uppermost mantle is found
  under the Mezenskaya depression and under the east flank of the Urals. One
  almost continuous upper mantle boundary occurs at 65- to 80-km depth, and
  another with an approximately 40-km-thick LVZ occurs at 120- to 140-km depth.
  The shallow upper mantle blocks and the two extensive interfaces indicate
  strong upper mantle heterogeneity. Resolution analysis based on direct
  multivariate model perturbations, artificial neural network
  and principal component analysis, indicate the depth uncertainty of the
  410-km discontinuity within +/-6 km, and also its trade-off with dip and
  velocities above and below the discontinuity. Decreased near-critical
  amplitudes of reflections from the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities indicate
  that these boundaries are most likely represented by gradient zones about
  15-20 km thick. Lithosphere thins, asthenospheric velocity decreases, and the
  410-km discontinuity dips to the SE approaching the Himalayan orogenic belt.

Title
  Detection and analysis of naturally fractured gas reservoirs: Multiazimuth
  seismic surveys in the Wind River basin, Wyoming
Source
  Geophysics. 64(4):1277-1292, 1999 Jul-Aug.
Abstract
  Multiazimuth binning of 3-D P-wave reflection data is a relatively simple but
  robust way of characterizing the spatial distribution of gas-producing
  natural fractures. In our survey, data were divided into two volumes by ray
  azimuth (approximately perpendicular and parallel (+/-45 degrees) to the
  dominant fracture strike) and separately processed. Azimuthal differences or
  ratios of attributes provided a rough measure of anisotropy. Improved imaging
  was also attained in the more coherent fracture-parallel volume. A
  neural network using azimuthally dependent velocity,
  reflectivity, and frequency attributes identified commercial gas wells with
  greater than 85% success. Furthermore, we were able to interpret the physical
  mechanisms of most of these correlations and so better generalize the
  approach. The apparent velocity anisotropy was compared to that derived from
  other P- and S-wave methods in an inset three-component survey. Prestack
  determination of the azimuthal moveout ellipse will best quantify velocity
  anisotropy, but simple two- or four-azimuth poststack analysis can adequately
  identify regions of high fracture density and gas yield. [References: 40]

Title
  Seismic source classification in Israel by signal imaging
  and rule-based coincidence evaluation
Source
  Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. 89(4):960-969, 1999 Aug.
Abstract
  We tested the applicability of the sonogram detector and a rule-based
  evaluation for seismic source classification and
  identification in Israel. Source identification is based on the
  transformation of full seismograms to images and the correlation between a
  new image and known images from different seismic sources.
  These methods were initially developed to monitor the induced
  seismicity of northwest Germany by the BUG small array. Two
  new elements were introduced in this study: (a) the adaptation of the array
  technique to the identification of seismic sources using a
  local network and (b) the recognition of source regions with natural
  seismicity. The tested data include 41 local earthquakes and
  explosions in the time period September 1997 to December 1997. Automated
  processing yielded 95% success in correctly identifying the individual
  sources with no misclassification. One event was not classified. Path and
  distance effects did not influence the classification capability. The method
  could be useful for seismic verification under the
  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. [References: 20]

  Neural network system for the analysis of transient
  phenomena on board the DEMETER micro-satellite
Source
  IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics Communications & Computer
  Sciences. E82A(8):1575-1581, 1999 Aug.
Abstract
  In 2001, the DEMETER micro-satellite will be launched to perform Detection of
  Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions. Its main
  scientific objective is related to the investigation of the ionospheric
  perturbations due to the seismic and volcanic activity. A
  system allowing an onboard identification and characterization of spatially
  and temporally coherent structures associated with the measurement of one or
  several electromagnetic wave field components is used. It is based on
  neural networks. The choice and training of the
  neural network are done on the ground from available
  waveforms. The parameters of the neural network system are
  then transmit ted to the satellite. This reconfiguration process can be
  repeated whenever necessary during the space mission. Details about the
  functioning and coding optimization for DSP implementation is presented. The
  first function of this system which will be per formed on the satellite
  DEMETER is the real-time identification and characterization of whistler
  phenomena. An application to the analysis of such phenomena observed in data
  from the AUREOL-3 satellite is exposed. [References: 14]

Title
  Probabilistic neural networks for seismic
  damage mechanisms prediction
Source
  Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics. 28(8):807-821, 1999 Aug.
Abstract
  The procedure commonly employed to assess the seismic
  vulnerability of buildings uses simplified qualitative and quantitative
  observations obtained from the measured data entered into report forms. In
  Italy, the data sheets adopted by the National Defence Group against
  Earthquakes (Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dal Terremoti-GNDT) play a
  unifying and reference role. This paper proposes a method for the processing
  of the data contained in such report forms which is based on probabilistic
  neural networks producing a Bayesian classification. The
  final goal is to exploit the fundamental learning and generalization
  capabilities of neural networks to obtain an estimate of the
  vulnerability of structural systems. In particular, the aim is to be able to
  predict the damage mechanisms which may be triggered in the macro-elements of
  public worship buildings. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title
  Velocity inversion in cross-hole seismic tomography by
  counter-propagation neural network, genetic algorithm and
  evolutionary programming techniques
Source
  Geophysical Journal International. 138(1):108-124, 1999 Jul.
Abstract
  The disadvantages of conventional seismic tomographic ray
  tracing and inversion by calculus-based techniques include the assumption of
  a single ray path for each source-receiver pair, the non-inclusion of head
  waves, long computation times, and the difficulty in finding ray paths in a
  complicated velocity distribution. ii ray-tracing algorithm is therefore
  developed using the reciprocity principle and dynamic programming approach.
  This robust forward calculation routine is subsequently used for the
  cross-hole seismic velocity inversion.
 
  Seismic transmission tomography can be considered to be a
  function approximation problem; that is, of mapping the traveltime vector to
  the velocity vector. This falls under the purview of pattern classification
  problems, so we propose a forward-only counter-propagation
  neural network (CPNN technique for the tomographic imaging
  of the subsurface. The limitation of neural networks,
  however, lies in the requirement of exhaustive training for its use in
  routine interpretation.
 
  Since finding the optimal solution, sometimes from poor initial models, is
  the ultimate goal, global optimization and search techniques such as
  simulated evolution are also implemented in the cross-well traveltime
  tomography. Genetic algorithms (GA), evolution strategies and evolutionary
  programming (EP) are the main avenues of research in simulated evolution.
  Part of this investigation therefore deals with GA and EP schemes for
  tomographic applications. In the present work on simulated evolution, a new
  genetic operator called 'region-growing mutation' is introduced to speed up
  the search process.
 
  The potential of the forward-only CPNN, GA and EP methods is demonstrated in
  three synthetic examples. Velocity tomograms of the first model present
  plausible images of a diagonally orientated velocity contrast bounding two
  constant-velocity areas by both the CPNN and GA schemes, but the EP scheme
  could not image the model completely. In the second case, while GA and EP
  schemes generated an accurate velocity distribution of a faulted layer in a
  homogeneous background, the CPNN scheme overestimated the vertical
  displacement of the fault. One can easily identify five voids in a coal seam
  from the GA-constructed tomogram of the third synthetic model, but the CPNN
  and EP schemes could not replicate the model. The performances of these
  methods are subsequently tested in a real field setting at Dhandadih
  Colliery, Raniganj Coalfields, West Bengal, India. First arrival traveltime
  inversion by these algorithms from 225 seismic traces
  revealed a P-wave velocity distribution from 1.0 to 2.5 km s(-1). A
  low-velocity zone (1.0 km s(-1)), the position of a suspected gallery in the
  Jambad Top coal seam, could be successfully delineated by CPNN, GA and EP
  schemes. [References: 33]

Title
  ASDP: a PC-based program using a multi-algorithm approach for automatic
  detection and location of local earthquakes
Source
  Physics of the Earth & Planetary Interiors. 113(1-4 Special Issue SI):57-74,
  1999 Jun.
Abstract
  A few automated data acquisition and processing systems operate on
  mainframes, some are run on UNIX-based workstations and others on personal
  computer, equipped with either DOS or UNIX-derived operating systems. Several
  large and complex software packages for automatic and interactive analysis of
  seismic data have been developed in recent years mainly for
  UNIX-based systems, and some of these programs use a variety of artificial
  intelligence techniques. Hen, the first operational version of a new software
  package, named PC-Seism, for analyzing seismic data from a
  local network is presented. This package, composed of three separate modules,
  provides an example of a new generation of visual object-oriented programs
  for interactive and automatic seismic data processing run on
  a personal computer. In particular, we discuss the automatic procedures
  implemented in the ASDP (Automatic Seismic Data Processing)
  module. A multi-algorithm approach to the on-line detection and location of
  local earthquakes is adopted in ASDP, and its operative mode is similar to
  that used in more complex systems, where the algorithms run on different
  processors and parallel computations are generally performed. Since highly
  complex computation routines may still be prohibitive for current PC when the
  number of analyzing traces becomes large, we have opted for simplicity and
  have planned three main routines (working in cascade mode) and a
  multi-station analysis (MSA) procedure in ASDP, to recognize phase picking,
  declare and locate earthquakes. Basically, signal detection on a
  single-component trace is obtained by a short-term average to long-term
  average ratio (STA/LTA) taken along a characteristic function (CF) envelope
  generated from the seismogram. To confirm and identify earthquake phase
  arrivals and to discard noise disturbances, two other sections of analysis
  are applied on short signal windows after the declared triggers. A spectral
  analysis is applied as detector of earthquake phase arrivals. Furthermore,
  for three-component data, the application of a polarization filter is used to
  identify P- and S-phases, Therefore in order to optimize the efficiency of a
  seismic monitoring system, the software is provided with
  full detection capability and makes use of a high degree of automation, aimed
  at minimizing the analyst's workload. PC-Seism and, in particular, the ASDP
  module are under constant review. In fact, the modular structure of the
  program will allow us to develop it with new and improved capabilities.
  Future developments improvements in ASDP will concern the application of
  other detection algorithms and routines to recognize secondary phases in
  regional and teleseismic earthquakes. (C) 1999 Elsevier

  Application of quadratic neural networks to
  seismic signal classification
Source
  Physics of the Earth & Planetary Interiors. 113(1-4 Special Issue
  SI):103-110, 1999 Jun.
Abstract
  This paper solves the seismic signal classification problem
  using the quadratic neural networks with closed-boundary
  discriminating surfaces. In this study, we have demonstrated the quadratic
  neural network (QNN) potential capabilities in application
  to the seismic signal classification problems and show that
  the efficiency achieved here, is much better to what obtained with
  conventional multilayer neural networks. Firstly, we have
  performed some pre-processing on the long period recordings to cancel out the
  instrumental and attenuation side effects. Secondly, we have extracted the
  ARMA filter coefficients of the windowed P-wave phase through some matrix
  manipulations using the conventional Prony ARMA modeling scheme. The derived
  coefficients are then applied to QNN for training and classification. The
  results have shown that a quadratic neuron is likely to have a performance
  similar to that of a multilayer perceptron when the target is to discriminate
  distribution of points in clusters within the input space. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title
  Explosion site recognition; neural net discriminator using
  single three-component stations
Source
  Physics of the Earth & Planetary Interiors. 113(1-4 Special Issue
  SI):131-142, 1999 Jun.
Abstract
  In monitoring of local seismicity, the occurrence of many
  chemical explosions poses sever practical problems of two kinds: (i) such
  recordings add significantly to the analyst workload and (ii) in extreme
  cases, pollute the seismicity data base to the extent of
  rendering it useless for serious scientific studies. In some countries, the
  local seismicity is equivalent to felt earthquakes but the
  problem remains since both earthquakes and explosions are and will be
  recorded by local stations. These events will therefore enter the network
  data center processing system, and thus, be subjected to further analysis.
  Source classification schemes are not always well suited for this kind of
  needed analysis at local distance ranges (not easily transportable). Besides,
  epicenter determinations may be less accurate in cases of few station
  reportings. The common denominator for failures is the modest usages of the
  information potential contained in seismic recordings being
  represented by a few time/amplitude parameters for the Pn- and Lg-phases. On
  the other hand, seismic waveform similarities for closely
  spaced earthquakes and explosions in particular are well established
  observationally. In this study period, we explore the possibility of using
  single station three-component (3C) covariance matrix traces from a priori
  known explosion sites (learning) for automatically recognizing subsequent
  explosions from the same site. To ensure adequate sampling, we used the nine
  different complex covariance time domain elements in combination with a suit
  of 12 bandpass filters equivalent to 108 observation pieces for a single
  event recording. We used a neural net scheme for teaching
  the computer to recognize new explosion recordings from a specific site
  through scanning of hundreds of detector segmented waveform files. No
  epicenter information was used in this analysis. The output was a single
  number between Zero and Four (log-scale) with an acceptance threshold
  (repeated explosion) of 1.2-analyst friendly usage. Actual tests were
  performed on two explosion sites of western Norway for which ground truth
  information was available. The 100% correct decisions were obtained between
  'site explosions' and hundreds of non-site events. A brute force test on the
  relative merits of the 12 frequency bands used gave that the 2-4 Hz and 8-12
  Hz spectral parts were most informative. Experiment tied to two quarry sites
  for which ground truth information was lacking gave less sharp separation of
  site and non-site events. Since covariance elements comprise P- and
  S-waveform jointly, good spatial sampling is ensured even for single site 3C
  stations; beyond 10 km from the epicenter the scores were in the non-site
  category, The above approach to event discrimination is very flexible as we
  may combine several 3C stations with even z-component stations and besides,
  no analyst action in My way will be needed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
