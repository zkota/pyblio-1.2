AB  - Recently the main targets of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) of primary
      biliary cirrhosis have been identified as parts of three related
      mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase
      (PDH), branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BKDH) and
      alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH). Usually AMA-
      positive PBC serum samples show reactivity to more than one of
      these, raising the question whether they are exclusively different
      antibodies or are, at least in part, the result of cross-reactive
      specificities. With Western immunoblotting, four antigens with
      molecular masses of 74, 52, 51 and 43 kDa, are recognized by PBC
      sera. In this study, using affinity purified antibodies from
      mitochondrial proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose blots, we
      demonstrate the presence of peptide-specific and cross-reactive
      epitopes in some targets. In particular, at least three different
      epitopes present in the 74-kDa protein (presumed to by PDH-E2) are
      also present in the 51-kDa protein (probably PDH-X), and two in the
      52-kDa peptide (possibly BCKDH-E2). Moreover, the 43-kDa
      mitochondrial protein (the identity of which is more problematic)
      has three epitopes. One of these is also present in the 74-, 52- and
      51-kDa proteins, a second in the 74- and 51-kDa, and a third seems
      to be peptide-specific. These results show that different sera with
      the same immunoblotting pattern of reactivity can have antibodies
      with different antigenic specificities and, conversely, that the
      same specificity can be responsible for more than one band.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertransaminasaemia of unknown, cryptogenic, origin
      occasionally has been found to be the only sign of coeliac disease.
      Raised concentrations of transaminases, or aminotransferases, have
      been retrospectively observed in about a half of patients with
      coeliac disease who are on a gluten-containing diet. We aimed to
      establish the overall prevalence of coeliac disease among patients
      with cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia. METHODS: Of the 600
      consecutive patients referred to our outpatient clinic for liver
      disease due to raised serum transaminases from September, 1995, to
      June, 1997, 55 were classified as having cryptogenic
      hypertransaminasaemia after the exclusion of every known cause of
      liver disease. These patients were tested by indirect
      immunofluorescence for IgA to endomysium and for IgA and IgG to
      gliadin. FINDINGS: Five patients were positive for both IgA to
      endomysium and IgG to gliadin, whereas IgA to gliadin was only found
      in four patients. IgG to gliadin was also present in another patient
      who was not positive for antibodies to endomysium. The six antibody-
      positive patients had duodenal biopsy that showed a subtotal villous
      atrophy consistent with coeliac disease in the five patients with
      antibodies to endomysium. The patient with only IgG to gliadin had a
      normal small-intestine mucosa. None of the five patients with
      coeliac disease had gastrointestinal symptoms. Liver biopsy samples
      were taken from three of the five patients with flat mucosa and
      showed a histological picture of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.
      Transaminase concentrations reverted to normal within 6 months in
      four patients with coeliac disease who followed a strict gluten-free
      diet. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that about 9% of patients
      with cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia are affected by symptom-free
      coeliac disease. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy and antibody screening
      for coeliac disease by means of antibodies to endomysium and gliadin
      should be considered in these patients.

AB  - Acute and severe impairment of liver function with jaundice and ascites
      occurred in two out of seven patients with chronic hepatitis D
      during interferon alpha administration (10 MU three times a week).
      Both of them were young women with histological diagnoses of
      moderate to severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis with no signs of
      portal hypertension. Only a slow and partial recovery was observed
      after interferon withdrawal. Autoantibodies against basal cell layer
      tested positive in these two patients. In the remaining five
      patients with hepatitis D who did not experience liver impairment
      during interferon administration, basal cell layer antibodies were
      found only in one case. We conclude that severe decompensation of
      liver cirrhosis related to hepatitis D may occur during interferon
      administration. Positivity of basal cell layer antibodies may be
      associated with the risk of developing such an adverse event but our
      data are not sufficient to prove this association.

AB  - Liver Kidney Microsomal type 1 (LKM1) antibody, the diagnostic marker of
      autoimmune hepatitis type 2, is also found in a proportion of
      patients with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). It is detected
      conventionally by the subjective immunofluorescence technique. Our
      aim was to establish a simple and objective enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures antibodies to cytochrome
      P4502D6 (CYP2D6), the target of LKM1. An indirect ELISA using
      eukaryotically expressed CYP2D6 was designed. Absorbance values
      obtained against a reference microsomal preparation were subtracted
      from those obtained against a microsomal preparation over-expressing
      CYP2D6, thus removing the non- CYP2D6-specific reaction. Sera from
      51 LKM1 positive patients (21 autoimmune hepatitis and 30 with HCV
      infection), 111 LKM1 negative patients with chronic liver disease
      (including 20 with HCV infection) and 43 healthy controls were
      tested. Of 51 patients positive by immunofluorescence, 48 were also
      positive by ELISA while all the 154 LKM1 negative subjects were also
      negative by ELISA. There was a high degree of association between
      IFL and ELISA as demonstrated by a kappa reliability value of 0.96.
      The absorbance values by ELISA correlated with immunofluorescence
      LKM1 titres both in autoimmune hepatitis (r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and
      HCV infection (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). The simple, objective ELISA
      described has the potential to replace the standard
      immunofluorescence technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 (LKM1) and liver
      cytosol antibody type 1 (LC1) are the serological markers of type 2
      autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). AIMS: Since LKM1 and LC1 react against
      two distinct liver specific autoantigens (cytochrome P450IID6
      (CYP2D6) and a 58 kDa cytosolic polypeptide respectively), the aim
      was to see whether LKM1 and LC1 concentrations correlate with liver
      disease activity. PATIENTS: Twenty one patients with type 2 AIH were
      studied. METHODS: All sera were tested by indirect
      immunofluorescence, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and immunoblotting
      visualised by enhanced chemiluminescence. To evaluate LKM1 and LC1
      levels, the 50 kDa microsomal reactivity (corresponding to CYP2D6)
      and the 58 kDa cytosolic reactivity were quantified by densitometric
      analysis. RESULTS: Seven patients were positive for LKM1, nine for
      LC1, and five for both. Serial serum samples at onset and during
      immunosuppressive treatment were analysed in 13 patients (four
      positive for LKM1, six positive for LC1 and three positive for
      both). During remission, LKM1 concentration remained essentially
      unchanged in six of seven patients, and decreased in only one.
      Conversely, in two of nine patients, LC1 was completely lost, and,
      in the remaining seven, LC1 concentration was reduced by more than
      50%. After immunosuppression tapering or withdrawal, flare ups of
      liver necrosis ensued with increasing LC1 concentration, but not
      LKM1. CONCLUSIONS: LC1 concentration, at variance with that of LKM1,
      parallels liver disease activity, and its participation in the
      pathogenic mechanisms of liver injury can be hypothesised.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implicated in the development of a
      variety of autoimmune phenomena, some of which are well documented
      and include a panel of auto-antibodies shared with autoimmune
      hepatitis (AIH). Anti-nuclear (ANA) and smooth muscle (SMA)
      antibodies (markers of AIH type 1 [AIH-1]), have been demonstrated
      in 9-38% and 5-91% of cases respectively, whereas anti-liver/kidney
      microsomal type 1 (anti- LKM-1) and anti-liver cytosol type 1
      antibodies (anti-LC1) (markers of AIH type 2 [AIH-2]), are
      definitely rarer, especially in adults. The presence of these
      auto-reactivities in chronic hepatitis C generates clinical overlaps
      and dilemmas in the correct classification and treatment of such
      patients. The immunopathological characterization of the
      auto-antibodies, anti-nuclear and smooth muscle antibodies in
      particular, combined with internationally defined criteria for the
      diagnosis of AIH is helpful in this clinical process. Thyroid auto-
      antibodies and cryoprecitable rheumatoid factors are also commonly
      detected in hepatitis C, while the occurrence of other
      auto-antibodies still awaits confirmation.

AB  - Celiac disease has been associated with autoimmune disorders, but its
      frequency in autoimmune hepatitis is unknown. Sera from 157 patients
      with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, 24 patients with type 2 autoimmune
      hepatitis, 62 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 30 patients
      with chronic hepatitis B, and 80 patients with chronic hepatitis C
      were tested for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies by
      indirect immunofluorescence and immunoglobulin A and G antibodies to
      gliadin by enzyme immunoassay. Duodenal biopsy evaluation was
      recommended in patients seropositive for immunoglobulin A
      anti-endomysial antibodies. Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial
      antibodies were present in eight of the 181 patients with autoimmune
      hepatitis (4%), including six with type 1 disease (4%) and two with
      type 2 disease (8%). Immunoglobulin A antibodies to gliadin were
      found in six of these eight patients, but they were also present in
      two others, including one patient with chronic hepatitis C. Five of
      the eight patients with immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies,
      including three patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms, had
      duodenal biopsies and subtotal villous atrophy was present in all of
      them. No patient with primary biliary cirrhosis or chronic viral
      hepatitis had antiendomysial antibodies. The presence of celiac
      disease in autoimmune hepatitis is high (at least one in 36
      patients) and it is predominantly asymptomatic. Screening with
      anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibodies should be performed and
      results confirmed with intestinal biopsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several retrospective and prospective studies report an
      increased prevalence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies (NOSAs) in
      patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related chronic liver disease
      (CLD). Some of the data so far available are controversial and the
      true prevalence of NOSAs in the general population is still not
      known. AIM: To explore the prevalence of NOSAs, their relation to
      different HCV genotypes, and the presence and severity of CLD in the
      general population of Northern Italy. PATIENTS: All 226 anti-HCV
      positive and 87 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive
      patients of the Dionysos cohort study were analysed and compared
      with sex and age matched cases (226) negative for both anti-HCV
      antibody and HBsAg selected from the same cohort. METHODS: Sera
      tested for the presence of NOSAs (anti-nuclear antibody (ANA),
      anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and anti-liver/kidney microsomes
      type 1 antibody (LKM1)) were screened by indirect immunofluorescence
      at a 1:40 serum dilution. HCV RNA and HCV genotypes were also
      determined by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 5'
      non-coding region and by PCR amplification of the core region with
      type specific primers. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of NOSA
      reactivity was significantly higher in anti-HCV positive subjects
      than in both normal and pathological controls (25% v 6% and 7%
      respectively, p<0.05). ANA, SMA, and LKM1 occurred in 16, 10, and 1.
      3% of cases respectively. No specific association between NOSAs and
      a specific HCV genotype was found. NOSAs were found more often
      associated with more than one genotype (35.7%) and with untypable
      genotypes (34.6%), although the association was not statistically
      significant. NOSAs were associated with HCV RNA and CLD but not with
      the presence of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. On
      univariate analysis, NOSA reactivity was independently associated
      with abnormal alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and
      gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels (p<0.05). The risk for the
      presence of NOSAs was 5.1 times higher in anti-HCV subjects than in
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the general population the prevalence of
      NOSAs is higher in anti-HCV positive subjects than in normal or
      disease controls. Moreover NOSAs are associated with CLD and with a
      more active disease in terms of alanine aminotransferase activity.

AB  - Molecular fusions of CD4, the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV), with immunoglobulin (termed CD4 immunoadhesins) possess both
      the gp120-binding and HIV-blocking properties of recombinant soluble
      CD4, and certain properties of IgG, notably long plasma half-life
      and Fc receptor binding. Here we show that a CD4 immunoadhesin can
      mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) towards
      HIV-infected cells, although, unlike natural anti-gp120 antibodies,
      it does not allow ADCC towards uninfected CD4-expressing cells that
      have bound soluble gp120 to the CD4 on their surface. In addition,
      CD4 immunoadhesin, like natural IgG molecules, is efficiently
      transferred across the placenta of a primate. These observations
      have implications for the therapeutic application of CD4
      immunoadhesins, particularly in the area of perinatal transmission
      of HIV infection.
