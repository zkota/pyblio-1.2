TI  - Small-molecule metabolism: an enzyme mosaic.
PG  - 482-6
AB  - Escherichia coli has been a popular organism for studying metabolic
      pathways. In an attempt to find out more about how these pathways are
      constructed, the enzymes were analysed by defining their protein domains.
      Structural assignments and sequence comparisons were used to show that 213
      domain families constitute approximately 90% of the enzymes in the
      small-molecule metabolic pathways. Catalytic or cofactor-binding
      properties between family members are often conserved, while recognition
      of the main substrate with change in catalytic mechanism is only observed
      in a few cases of consecutive enzymes in a pathway. Recruitment of domains
      across pathways is very common, but there is little regularity in the
      pattern of domains in metabolic pathways. This is analogous to a mosaic in
      which a stone of a certain colour is selected to fill a position in the
      picture.

TI  - The evolution and structural anatomy of the small molecule metabolic
      pathways in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 693-708
AB  - The 106 small molecule metabolic (SMM) pathways in Escherichia coli are
      formed by the protein products of 581 genes. We can define 722 domains,
      nearly all of which are homologous to proteins of known structure, that
      form all or part of 510 of these proteins. This information allows us to
      answer general questions on the structural anatomy of the SMM pathway
      proteins and to trace family relationships and recruitment events within
      and across pathways. Half the gene products contain a single domain and
      half are formed by combinations of between two and six domains. The 722
      domains belong to one of 213 families that have between one and 51
      members. Family members usually conserve their catalytic or cofactor
      binding properties; substrate recognition is rarely conserved. Of the 213
      families, members of only a quarter occur in isolation, i.e. they form
      single-domain proteins. Most members of the other families combine with
      domains from just one or two other families and a few more versatile
      families can combine with several different partners.Excluding isoenzymes,
      more than twice as many homologues are distributed across pathways as
      within pathways. However, serial recruitment, with two consecutive enzymes
      both being recruited to another pathway, is rare and recruitment of three
      consecutive enzymes is not observed. Only eight of the 106 pathways have a
      high number of homologues. Homology between consecutive pairs of enzymes
      with conservation of the main substrate-binding site but change in
      catalytic mechanism (which would support a simple model of retrograde
      pathway evolution) occurs only six times in the whole set of enzymes. Most
      of the domains that form SMM pathways have homologues in non-SMM pathways.
      Taken together, these results imply a pervasive "mosaic" model for the
      formation of protein repertoires and pathways.

TI  - From molecular activities and processes to biological function.
PG  - 81-93
AB  - This paper describes how biological function can be represented in terms
      of molecular activities and processes. It presents several key features of
      a data model that is based on a conceptual description of the network of
      interactions between molecular entities within the cell and between cells.
      This model is implemented in the aMAZE database that presently deals with
      information on metabolic pathways, gene regulation, sub- or supracellular
      locations, and transport. It is shown that this model constitutes a useful
      generalisation of data representations currently implemented in metabolic
      pathway databases, and that it can furthermore include multiple schemes
      for categorising and classifying molecular entities, activities, processes
      and localisations. In particular, we highlight the flexibility offered by
      our system in representing multiple molecular activities and their
      control, in viewing biological function at different levels of resolution
      and in updating this view as our knowledge evolves.

TI  - Traditional Maori food preparation methods and food safety.
PG  - 183-90
AB  - Descriptions were obtained from Maori elders knowledgeable in traditional
      methods for the processing of Tiroi (mussels and Puha), Kina (sea
      urchins), Kanga Kopiro (fermented maize) and Titi (muttonbird).
      Information for a number of variations of each method was transformed into
      process flow charts, and these charts were analysed using a HACCP-based
      approach. Two of the processes (Kanga Kopiro and Titi) were found to be
      likely to produce safe foods as Kanga Kopiro undergoes an acid
      fermentation and Titi preparation involves significant cooking steps.
      However, the information regarding Tiroi and Kina processing did not
      supply the necessary data to identify definitely whether fermentations
      were involved, and if they were, what kind they may be. New Zealand has
      only experienced one outbreak of botulism, and this was associated with
      the consumption of Tiroi. It is, therefore, desirable to identify the
      processes occurring in these foods where the nature of these processes is
      not understood in order to facilitate their safe future production.

TI  - Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the complete
      genome sequence.
PG  - 537-44
AB  - Countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis, a chronic
      infectious disease caused by the tubercle bacillus. The complete genome
      sequence of the best-characterized strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
      H37Rv, has been determined and analysed in order to improve our
      understanding of the biology of this slow-growing pathogen and to help the
      conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The genome
      comprises 4,411,529 base pairs, contains around 4,000 genes, and has a
      very high guanine + cytosine content that is reflected in the blased
      amino-acid content of the proteins. M. tuberculosis differs radically from
      other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding capacity is
      devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and
      lipolysis, and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a
      repetitive structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation.
